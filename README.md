Known Issues/Bugs
Overdue Calculation:
The overdue calculation currently uses a fixed 14-day limit. Depending on library policies, this may need to be configurable or adjusted to accommodate different loan periods.

Error Handling for Invalid Inputs:
While most errors are handled, some edge cases (e.g., malformed requests, missing required fields) may not be fully covered. More comprehensive input validation and error responses could improve the user experience.

Book Availability Check:
If the total number of copies is updated (e.g., if new books are added), the available copies check during borrowing may not update as expected in real-time. This might cause inconsistencies if multiple users are attempting to borrow the same book at the same time.

No Authentication:
The current implementation does not include user authentication or authorization. Any member or admin can perform actions such as borrowing books or updating records without verifying their identity or role. This could be a security concern in a production environment.

Performance on Large Datasets:
With a large number of books or members, the current database queries may take longer to execute. Optimizing query performance and adding pagination for large lists can improve efficiency.

Missing Notifications for Overdue Books:
The system doesn't notify members when their borrowed books are overdue. Adding email or SMS notifications would improve user engagement and ensure timely returns.
